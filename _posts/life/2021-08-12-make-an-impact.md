Do you think it's hard to get successful? Is it hard to become famous? Then you don't know what makes a person get that fame, that uniqueness!

All it matters is how much impact you make on the society, how many people did you reach with your voice, what change did you bring in the society with your thoughts and ideas...

It all boils doin to taking proactive steps to change the world you live in, it doesn't matter how big you start, small steps make up big! Go, make that kid happy, give a subtle help to someone, and that starts the chain.
